# Instructions for Running Migrations

To apply the new database migrations for venue booking support, follow these steps:

1. Activate your virtual environment:
   ```
   cd server
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   # or
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

2. Run the migrations:
   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. Restart the Django server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

These migrations add support for venue bookings in the Bookings model by:
- Making the room field nullable
- Adding an area (venue) field
- Adding an is_venue_booking flag
- Adding a total_price field
- Adding valid_id and special_request fields to the Reservations model

The changes allow us to use the existing /bookings endpoint for both room and venue bookings.
